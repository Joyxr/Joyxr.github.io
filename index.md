Welcome :wave: I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, under the supervision of [Prof. Lin DAI](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~lindai/). Prior to this, I received the B.Eng. degree in the School of Electronic Information and Communications from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2020. My current research focuses on the modeling, analysis and optimal design of multiple access protocols.
