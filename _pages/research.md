### Random Access: Modeling, Delay Analysis, and Optimal Design

With the ever-growing demand for low-latency services in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, the delay performance of random access networks has become a primary concern, which critically depends on: 1) sensing-free or sensing-based, 2) connection-free or connection-based, and 3) backoff.

To understand the effect of the abovementioned design features on the optimal delay performance, the challenge lies in unifying the delay analysis of sensing-free Aloha and sensing-based Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with various design features such as backoff and connection-free or connection-based. In our previous studies [1]-[2], a unified analytical framework is established for characterizing and optimizing the mean queueing delay of data packets in random access networks.
