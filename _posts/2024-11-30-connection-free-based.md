According to whether a connection to the receiver is established before data transmission, random access schemes can be divided into two categories: connection-based and connection-free. For cellular networks, its connection-based access mechanism has been heavily criticized for being ill-suited to Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. With the existing studies overwhelmingly focusing on the physical-layer transmission and detection design of various connection-free access schemes, less attention has been paid to the fundamental understanding of when connection establishment could be beneficial.
    
The challenge originates from the lack of proper modeling of connection-based random access. In this paper, a scalable model that incorporates each node's queueing behavior is proposed for connection-based slotted Aloha, based on which both the data throughput and the mean queueing delay of data packets are characterized, optimized, and compared with those for connection-free slotted Aloha. Conditions for beneficial connection establishment in terms of the optimal throughput and queueing delay performance are discussed and applied to cellular networks with the newly introduced Random Access-based Small Data Transmission (RA-SDT) schemes. The analysis offers important insights for the optimal access design of M2M communications.
